Release: 1.0

### Description

Annotate utilizes workflow actions to provide an easy way to remember and share events. Annotating an event associates a short note with the event, while flagging an event simply adds a searchable field value to it. Annotating adds a new annotate field to an event and sets a custom value or note as the value. Flagging an event simply sets the annotate field as 'flag'. 


## ---_Important_---

When performing an annotation, you __MUST__ wait for the search job to finish. Or else, Annotate cannot access the search ID to find the event. 


### How to annotate events

1. Perform a Splunk search using any application
2. In the search string, add:   
        _| eval annotate="YOUR NOTE"_ 
	- What is typed inside the quotes will be added as the annotation to the event
    - This will render the same search output, but allow us to add a custom field value
3. Open an event, and find the Event Actions 
	- Click "\*Annotate: " to annotate a single event
	- Click "\*Annotate All: " to annotate all events found in that search job


### How to flag events
	
1. Perform a Splunk search using any application
2. Open an event, and find the Event Actions 
    - Click "\*Flag: " to flag a single event
	- Click "\*Flag All: " to flag all events found in that search job


### View annotated events
  
- All
	* Shows all the events that are annotated or flagged  
- Annotations 
    * By default shows all annotated events
	* Allows you to search for annotated events
	* For multi-worded annotations, you can search subsets of the annotation
- Flags
	* Shows all flagged events  
- Search
    * Just normal Splunk searching
	

### Removing annotations

1. Navigate to splunk/etc/apps/annotate/lookups
2. Open the file ticket_correlation.csv (text editor works just fine)
3. Find the event(s) you want to delete, and remove the row(s)


### Customizations

- You can remove/disable workflow actions from Settings->Fields->Workflow Actions. If you don't think you will ever need an action, just disable it. 

- The dashboards have been left in XML, which means you can still edit them using Splunk's Dashboard Editor. You can add panels and inputs to any of the dashboards.
